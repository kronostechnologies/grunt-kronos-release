# grunt-kronos-release

> Manage release flow for Kronos Technologies applications

## Getting Started
This plugin requires Grunt.

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:

```shell
npm install grunt-kronos-release --save-dev
```

Once the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-kronos-release');
```

### Configuration
In your project's Gruntfile, add a section named `release` to the data object passed into `grunt.initConfig()`.  The options (and defaults) are:

```js
grunt.initConfig({
  release: {
    options: {
      devBranch: 'master',
      releaseBranch: 'release/main',
      stableBranch: 'stable/main',
      hotfixBranchPrefix: 'hotfix/',
      remote: 'origin',
      versionFile: 'package.json'
    }
  },
})
```

[grunt-bump](https://www.npmjs.org/package/grunt-bump) must be configured not to tag.

```js
bump: {
  options: {
    files: ['package.json', 'bower.json'],
    commitFiles: ['package.json', 'bower.json', 'CHANGELOG.md'],
    push: false,
    pushTo: 'origin',
    createTag: false 
  }
}
```

[grunt-git](https://www.npmjs.org/package/grunt-git) and [grunt-changelog](https://www.npmjs.org/package/grunt-changelog) should be installed in your project.

### Options

#### options.devBranch
Type: `String`
Default value: `master`

Development branch where feature complete code is shared between developper.

#### options.releaseBranch
Type: `String`
Default value: `release/main`

Release branch name. The stable branch is the branch for next release preparation and test build.

#### options.stableBranch
Type: `String`
Default value: `stable/main`

Stable branch name. The stable branch is the branch for production build.

#### options.hotfixBranchPrefix
Type: `String`
Default value: `hotfix/`

Prefix used by grunt `hotfix:start` and `hotfix:finish` to generate hotfix branch name from hotfix name.

#### options.upstreamBranch
Type: `String`
Default value: `upstream`

Upstream branch name. The upstream branch is the branch used to merge upstream sources.

#### options.remote
Type: `String`
Default value: `origin`

Git remote name for the repository.


#### options.versionFile
Type: `String`
Default value: `package.json`

JSON file to get the package current version.


### Usage Examples

#### Prepare new release to be packaged

To prepare a new release, code from development branch (master) is merged into release/main branch.  By default, version is incremented to a minor pre-release `0.X.0-1`.  Major pre-release `X.0.0-1` can also be achieved.

Code from `release/main` will be build by jenkins and installed in FNCT environment.


```
# Start a minor (1.X.0-1) version.
grunt release:start # or grunt release:start:minor

# Start a major (X.0.0-1) version.
grunt release:start:major
```

#### Do some fix for next release

During the stabilization period for the next release, fixes should be done in the `release/main` branch. Commits can be cherry-picked from master or new commit can be done directly on release/main.

During the stabilization process, merging `master` should be avoided. If it is absolutely necessary, you should merge `release/main` into `master` before merging `master` into `release/main`.  Finally,  do a `grunt release:continue` to complete the release update.

Keep in mind that the code should be feature complete before starting a new release.  Stabilization should be done in the release branch. *Donâ€™t do dev in FNCT.*


```
# Increment prerelease version (0.0.0-X)
grunt release:continue
```

 
#### Release the next version to production

During this step, we set the final version for next release and merge `release/main` into `stable/main`.  The version v1.X.0 will be done on `stable/main` branch.

Code from `stable/main` will be build by jenkins and installed in PROD environment.

Finally, `release/main` will also be meged into `master` to bring back stabilization fixes, version update and changelog for next release.


```
# Remove pre-release version, generate changelog,  merge into stable/main and tag final version.
grunt release:finish
```

#### Doing hotfix for production

Fixes in production production must be prepared in a `hotfix/hotifx-name` branch that branch from the `stable/main` branch.

The grunt `hotfix:start:fix-name` task create a new hotfix branch.  The grunt `hotfix:finish:fix-name` task increment the patch version and merge the hotfix branch into `release/main`.

The fix can be cherry-picked from `master` or `release/main` (with care) or committed directly to the hotfix branch.  Backport the fix for the next release will be explained in a further section.


```
# Start a new hotfix branch
grunt hotfix:start:fix-name

# Increment patch version, update changelog, merge into stable/main and tag final version.
grunt hotfix:finish:fix-name
```

#### Bring back hotfix changes if there is no release started.

When there is no release in stabilization process in release/main,  the stable/main branch can simply be mege into master after the hotfix.

```
git checkout master
git merge --no-ff stable/main # Should not conflict
```

#### Bring back hotfix changes hen a release is already started.

```
git checkout release/main
git merge --no-ff stable/main
# package.json and bower.json will conflict due to the version change in both branch.
git checkout -f origin/release/main -- package.json bower.json # Keep release/main version
grunt:release:contiue # Increment pre-release
```

#### Create an alternate release task

```js
grunt.registerTask('release-ia', 'Release for ia', function(releaseCmd, versionType){
  grunt.config.merge({
    release: {
      options: {
        releaseBranch: 'release/ia',
        stableBranch: 'stable/ia'
      }
    }
  });

 grunt.task.run('release:' + releaseCmd + ':' + versionType);
});

```
#### Packaging an upstream lib

Used for `kronos-php-*` and z-push

```
# Upstream version is 1.2.3 
# Current version is 1.2.2
# the upstream branch contains the upstream code to be fetched

# merge upstream changes to master
grunt upstream:merge

# < fix conflicts && review changes >

# package new upstream in master 
grunt upstream:pack:1.2.3

# > changes version 1.2.2-* to version 1.2.3-0

# Develop new features + send pull requests upstream

# When you are ready to release the lib
grunt upstream:repack

> creates version 1.2.3-1
> merges master to release/main
> triggers Jenkins build

# when lib is fully tested, merge release in stable
grunt upstream:stable

> merges release/main to stable/main
> triggers Jenkins build

```
